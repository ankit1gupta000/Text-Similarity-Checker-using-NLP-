# Text-Similarity-Checker-using-NLP-
A simple yet effective Text Similarity Checker using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn and NLTK. This version uses TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency) and Cosine Similarity, which are widely used in academic and real-world NLP applications.
